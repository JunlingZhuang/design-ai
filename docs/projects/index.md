You can work on as many issues as you like from one or both projects. Your work will be judged not on the number of issues you tackled but on the overall quality of your code and contribution.

To submit your work, please follow these steps **<u>for each issue</u>**:

1. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/danilnagy/design-ai/fork)
2. In your fork, create a new branch and call it `your-uni/issue-number`, for example `dn2216/85` if I was submitting for [https://github.com/danilnagy/design-ai/issues/85](https://github.com/danilnagy/design-ai/issues/85)
3. Push all changes pertaining to the issue to the branch
4. When you're done, submit a pull request with the same name as your branch

{: .warning }
Please remember to do these steps for each issue you want to submit work for. You should have a separate branch for each issue based on the main `gh-pages` branch, as well as a separate PR tied to each branch/issue.
