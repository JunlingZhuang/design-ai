# Setting up your environment

## Rhino / Grasshopper

CAD tool with visual scripting interface

## Python / RhinoCommon

Coding environment, access to Rhino geometry library

## Github

Kind of like working on a wiki - explicit file change tracking

In this tutorial we will build a recursive algorithm from scratch that can create a growing branching structure.

Files you will need for this tutorial:

| Start with these files          | In case you get lost, you can download the final solution here |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [0_start.3dm](data/0_start.3dm) |                                                                |
| [0_start.gh](data/0_start.gh)   | [0_end.gh](data/0_end.gh)                                      |

## Introduction

Open the files and locate the `code component`.

### Implementing the recursive call

```python
x = 5
def (ls):
    print "aha!"
```
